- 👋 Hi, I’m Mary Schiff, I've been teaching high school chemistry and physics for 18 years. I was born and raised in NYC and now live in Reno. I have always had some interest in web design, and as I got more into streaming on twitch I have also become curious about coding as well. As I start a new chapter of my life here in Reno, I feel like it might be time to reevaluate my career and learn something new. 
- 👀 I’m a huge nerd so I love anime and video games. I enjoy fantasy and science. Coming out to Reno has also awakened an unknown love for gardening, now that I have the space in which to plant things. I enjoy running events on twitch for charity, and as much as I also enjoy streaming and speedrunning, teaching often leaves me few spoons with which to do so.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript. We have already covered basic variables and console logs for execution, and are starting to work on more complex strings. I'm excited to get into HTML in a few weeks as I have previously dabbled back in the day when geocities and angelfire fan sites for anime were a thing.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate just yet, but I'm sure as I learn more that time will come!
